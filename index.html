        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I've been searching all my life. Searching for the right job, the right education. And I've never found it! Until now. HTML and CSS it just makes sense to me. I know that I don't know that must HTML and CSS yet, but at my level it just seems so right. I honestly doesn't see the code, I just see the finished picture. It's like my mind is a WYSIWYG HTML-editor</p>
        
        <p>I've never liked school, so it kind of ironic that I've, besides my regular school, have 4 educations to my name. Ohh... mabey I do like school, after all I'm in school again. This time at home wich is nice. I've worked as an electrician, solider, salesman, and a personal trainer.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I made my first wordpress website 10 years ago, hoping to make some money as an affiliate maketer. It didn't make me rich, as I hoped it would. But I did make alot of wordpress sites. Nothing fancy though. I didn't know anything about childthemes, php, css. I did try to build a few wesites in the <a href="http://kompozer.net" target="blank">Kompzer</a> WYSIWYG edtor. But I didn't know enough CSS to ever make sites look great.</p>
        <ul class="skills">

        </ul>

        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>I get up every morning at 4 am and meditate for an hour. 2 or 3 times a week I head to the gym right after my meditation. On the weekends I usually work out later in the day.</p>
        <p>One of my biggest hobbies is baking. Not cake, but bread. Jump to my <a href="hobbies.html">hobbies page</a> to  some of my homebaked breads.</p>
        <p>I allso enjoy playing with my three girls, (and their mother 'wink wink'), go to the movies, watching stand-up comedy, and just realxing at home.</p>
